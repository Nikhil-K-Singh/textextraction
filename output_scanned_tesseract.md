Dear Public Water System Owners Operators

The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory MSPHL is in the process of implementing a new
Laboratory Information Management System LIMS in its drinking water bacteriology testing
laboratory The OpenELIS OE LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample management
capability improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data entry error In addition the
system will provide improved reporting capabilities including direct electronic data exchange with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources MDNR Safe Drinking Water Information System
SDWIS SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report
testing results to you and the U S Environmental Protection Agency In addition the new OE LIMS will
provide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their own test results in real time

As the MSPHL implements this new computer system several changes will be made in the way you
collect and submit water samples for testing This letter and information packet will provide you with
information to help educate you on these changes

NEW SAMPLE BOTTLES

Beginning in August the MSPHL began using a larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing
This bottle has a shrink wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume Please read the
attached SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS for details on how to use these new bottles
Sample volume MUST be within the two lines on the bottle to be acceptable for
testing You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones Once you
have received the new bottles please discard or recycle the old bottles

NEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS

The traditional sample information card that has been used for more than twenty years is being
replaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form An example form is attached Please read the
attached instructions for information on properly completing the new form

Changes to the form include the following

Form size is expanded to a single x sheet of paper The form is no longer in a triplicate
carbon copy format You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer Note MDNR
does not require a public water system to retain copies of sample collection forms however you
might utilize them for system inspections

The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre populated with your Public Water Supply
ID number PWS name address and county Forms should not be shared with other supplies

www health mo gov

Healthy Missourians for life
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services will be the leader in promoting protecting and partnering for health

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EMPLOYER Services provided on a nondiscriminatory basis



Page
Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies they operate Blank forms will
be available for MDNR Regional Office staff use

The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector There are no longer
check boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location

Facility ID Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be
provided by the collector This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS
sampling plan MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their
approved sampling plan This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to
ensure regulatory compliance requirements have been met Failure to complete this information
on the sample collection form may result in a non compliance report from MDNR

A Collector Signature line has been added The sample collector must sign the form to attest the
information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge

The MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early
December Please begin using the new forms December Discard all the old forms cards
at that time

NEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

Sample instructions have been revised to include changes to the bottle and sampling form The
instructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample using the new bottle how to
complete the new sample collection form how to best ship samples to the MSPHL using the free
MSPHL courier system and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal A copy of these
instructions is attached

NEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS

The OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems to view and print their test result
reports check status of samples download sample information into Excel and receive automated emails
when samples are received at the laboratory and when sample results are ready to be viewed For
information on how to gain access to this portal please contact Shondra Johnson LIMS Administrator
at Shondra Johnson health mo gov or at

IMPLEMENTATION DATES

The MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December There will be a two
week testing period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with our current
manual paper based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly You may continue to submit
samples as you currently do using the old sample information card throughout this time

On December the MSPHL plans to go live with the new OE LIMS Samples submitted
after that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form At that time the
MSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have been granted access

The MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place
for many years The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system and we ask for
your patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory

If you have any questions please contact the MSPHL Environmental Bacteriology Unit at

You may also contact your MDNR Regional Office for additional information on sample
collection

Once again thank you for your patience and understanding as we implement these changes

Bacteriological Sample Collection Procedures

Assemble all of the sampling supplies Before you begin wash your hands
thoroughly before handling supplies Go to the sampling location s specified
in your Missouri Department of Natural Resources MDNR approved
sampling site plan The sample should be taken from a clean smooth nosed cold
water faucet if possible Avoid drinking fountains leaky faucets hot cold
mixing faucets and frost proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to
sterilize these fixtures If possible remove any aerators strainers or hoses
that are present because they may harbor bacteria Follow the procedures below
when collecting the sample Instructions for completing the environmental
sampling form are on the following page

Open the cold water tap for about minutes before collecting the sample
This should adequately flush the water line of any debris

Flame sterilize the tap and or chemically disinfect the tap Do not flame
sterilize if tap is plastic or if aerators are attached Disinfect tap by
thoroughly rinsing both the inside and outside of the tap with a mixture of
house hold bleach NaOCl and tap water Take extreme care with strong
bleach oxidizing solutions

Flush the tap for an additional minutes with cold water and then reduce
to a gentle flow to about the width of a pencil Do not change the water flow
once you have started sampling as this could dislodge contaminants in the tap

Remove the plastic shrink wrap seal by pulling down on the red strip and
pealing the shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle Discard the shrink
wrap Do not attempt to reseal the lid with shrink wrap still attached

Grasp cap along top edge and remove carefully Do not touch the inside
with your fingers Hold the bottle in one hand and the cap in the other Do not
lay the cap down or put it in a pocket Also take care not to contaminate the

sterile bottle or cap with your fingers or permit the faucet to touch the inside of

the bottle

Hold the bottle so that water entering the bottle will not come in contact with
your hands or the outside of the bottle

Fill the bottle until the water sample level is BETWEEN THE TWO
LINES on the bottle Preferably the sample level should be at
or just slightly above the line Sample levels below the lower
line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to insufficient sample volume Sample
levels above the upper line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to
overfilled bottle If the bottle is overfilled you may pour off any excess water
to get the sample level between the two lines Place the cap on the bottle and
screw it down tightly

Fill out the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services DHSS
State Public Health Lab SPHL Environmental Sample Collection Form
using waterproof ink See attached document for instructions on properly
completing the sample collection form and for shipping instructions

For single samples neatly fold the sample collection form into thirds standard
letter fold roll around the bottle and place in the shipping box For multiple
samples fold the forms once or more as needed and place in the shipping box
alongside the samples If needed use bubble pack or folded paper to fill space
Do not use shredded paper Seal the box with a single strip of shipping tape and
affix the return address label to the top of the box

Fill sample bottle until water level is
between the two lines on the bottle

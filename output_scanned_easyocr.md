Dear Public Water System Owners Operators
The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory MSPHL is in the process of implementing a new
Laboratory Information Management System LIMS in its drinking water bacteriology testing
laboratory The OpenELIS OE LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample management
capability improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data entry error In addition the
system will provide improved reporting capabilities including direct electronic data exchange with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources MDNR Safe Drinking Water Information System
SDWIS SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report
testing results to you and the U S Environmental Protection Agency In addition the new OE LIMS will

provide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their Own test results in real time

As the MSPHL implements this new computer system several changes will be made in the Way yoU

collect and submit water samples for testing This letter and information packet will provide you with

information to help educate you on these changes
NEW SAMPLE BOTTLES
Beginning in August the MSPHL began using larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing a
This bottle has shrink Wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume Please read the

attached SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS for details on how to use these new bottles
Sample volume MUST be within the two lines the bottle to be acceptable for
testing You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones Once you
have received the new bottles please discard or recycle the old bottles
NEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS
The traditional sample information card that has been used for more than twenty years is being
replaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form An example form is attached Please read the
attached instructions for information on properly completing the new form
Changes to the form include the following
Form size is expanded to a single x sheet of paper The form is no longer in a triplicate

carbon copy format You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer Note MDNR
require a public water system to retain does not of sample collection forms however you copies
might utilize them for system inspections

The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre populated with your Public Water Supply
ID number PWS name address and county Forms should not be shared with other supplies
Www health moqov
Healthy Missourians for life The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services will be the leader in promoting protecting and partnering for health
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EMPLOYER Services provided on a nondiscriminatory basis


Page
Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies they operate Blank forms will
be available for MDNR Regional Office staff
The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector There are no longer
check boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location
Facility ID Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be
provided by the collector This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS
sampling plan MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their
approved sampling plan This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to
regulatory compliance requirements have been met Failure to complete this information ensure
on the sample collection form may result in a non compliance report from MDNR
Signature line has been added The sample collector must sign the form to attest the A Collector
information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge
The MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early
using December Please begin the new forms December Discard all the old forms cards
at that time
NEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
Sample instructions have been revised include changes to the bottle and sampling form The
instructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample using the new bottle how to
complete the new sample collection form how to best ship samples to the MSPHL using the free
MSPHL courier system and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal A copy of these

instructions is attached
NEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS
The OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems view and their test result print
reports check status of samples download sample information into Excel and receive automated emails
when samples are received at the laboratory and when sample results are ready be viewed For

information on how to access to this portal please contact Shondra Johnson LIMS Administrator gain
at Shondra Johnson health mogoV or at

IMPLEMENTATION DATES
The MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December There will be a two
testing period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with Our current week
manual paper based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly You may continue to submit
samples using do as you currently the old sample information card throughout this time
On December the MSPHL plans to go live with the new OE LIMS Samples submitted
after that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form At that time the
MSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have been granted access

The MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place
for many years The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system and we ask for
your patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory

If you have any questions please contact the MSPHL Environmental Bacteriology Unit at
You may also contact your MDNR Regional Office for additional information on sample

Bacteriological Sample Collection Procedures

Assemble all of the Sampling supplies Before you begin wash your hands
thoroughly before handling supplies Go to the sampling location s specified
in your Missouri Department of Natural Resources MDNR approved
sampling site The sample should be taken from a clean smooth nosed cold
water faucet if possible Avoid drinking fountains leaky faucets hotlcold
mixing faucets and frost proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to
sterilize these fixtures If possible remove any aerators strainers or hoses

house hold bleach NaOCI and water Take extreme care with strong tap
bleach oxidizing solutions
Flush the tap for an additional minutes with cold water and then reduce
gentle flow to about the width of a pencil Do not change the water flow
